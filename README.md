My Name is Andrew Hess. I am currently enrolled at Chapman University. \n This GitHub has some of the projects that I have worked on during the time I am spending at Chapman University.\n
Project SuperConductor- \n
This project is python based that predicts the tempurature of Super Conductors. Certain metals have properties that allow them to have no resistance with the well-known term being a super conductor. This only happens when these metals reach a certain tempurature. This tempurature is very commonly very hard to maintain as the tempurature required for the super conductive properity is very cold. The goal is to have an ampiant pressure, ambiant tempurature super conductor. These  I have demonstrated my knowledge of using basic neural networks as well as sickit.learn. In this I saw the advantage of using nueral networks to find out the best "predictions" for superconductor tempuratures.
